  longBio: `I'm a passionate full-stack developer with expertise in building modern web applications. 
  With years of experience in React, Node.js, and cloud technologies, I create scalable and 
  maintainable solutions that deliver exceptional user experiences.

  My journey in software development began with a curiosity about how things work behind the scenes. 
  Over the years, I've honed my skills in both frontend and backend development, always staying 
  updated with the latest technologies and best practices.

  When I'm not coding, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, writing technical blog posts, 
  and sharing knowledge with the developer community. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code 
  and following best practices to build applications that stand the test of time.`,
