  longBio: `I'm a dedicated cybersecurity student with a passion for protecting systems and data 
  from evolving threats. With extensive training in security operations, threat landscape analysis, 
  and cloud security, I focus on identifying vulnerabilities and implementing comprehensive defense strategies.

  My journey in cybersecurity began with a fascination for how systems can be secured and protected. 
  Through numerous certifications including ISC2 domains, IBM Cloud Security, and Splunk fundamentals, 
  I've developed strong skills in threat intelligence, incident response, and security governance.

  I specialize in using industry-standard tools like Wireshark, Metasploit, Nmap, and Burp Suite for 
  security assessments. When I'm not hunting for vulnerabilities, I enjoy staying updated with the latest 
  security trends, analyzing threat reports, and contributing to the cybersecurity community through 
  knowledge sharing and best practices.`,
